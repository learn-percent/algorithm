# Project Introduction
Our goal this module is to create a calculator program, that uses NodeJS (with javascript programming language), that takes a sequence of input's, including the values we want to calculate and a operation, and outputs the result of the operation.

## Installation
1. Pull the repository in your computer
2. Install NodeJS
3. Run `npm install` at the project root

# Goes

- What is JavaScript;
- Basic notation of NodeJS and NPM;
- How to setup the project and how it's structured;
- How the tests will work;
- How to output text in NodeJS;
- Variable notions;
- Variable operations;
- Inputting text with prompt-sync;
- What is a statement;
- Understanding conditional (operations and usage in statements);
- Understanding looping statements;
- Understanding functions;

# Basic Computing Notions
## What's a Algorithm?
A Algorithm is a set of instructions that will solve a problem or accomplish a task.

## What's a Program?
A Program the process of taking a Algorithm and codding the solution into a programming language, so that will can be executed by a computer.

## What's a Programming Language?
Programming Languages are System's of notation to write computer programs. It's described by Syntax, which is the rules that combines symbols and the write way to write in said language.
