# The Web Revolution
The Original WEB idea was to share "[hypertext*](#glossary) documents" that could be viewed in a formated form by "[browsers*](#glossary)". It was a better way to display this documents without the need to have a copy of the file. This documents were very simple, but with web growing more and more, new technologies started to appear, making writing new pages easier, and making them prettier.

# Web Essensials
We have three technologies that exists in every website today, which are HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.

## HTML
HTML is responsable to organize the elements of the page that will be displayed. It can be a text, a image, a container, etc.
## CSS
CSS is responsable to the presentation of said elements. Text colors, background color, font size, margin, etc.
## JavaScript
Javascript is a programming language responsable to create a behavior in the elements. When button is clicked, change color, move to another page, do login, etc.

Browers will read the code written in this technologies in order to display the website the way the developers intended to.
Because this technologies are inteeded to create a view page to the user, they are linked with the term "[front-end*](#glossary)".

# More about JavaScript
With the Web growing had some consequences in programming world. One of them, is that to make creating website easier, web frameworks (like react, vue and angular) started to appear. Also, because javascript was the only language browers could read, a lot a programmers knew a lot of it, and it would be easier to use JavaScript to "[back-end*](#glossary)" programming as well.
So it comes "NodeJS", a program capable of reading and executing JavaScript code, without the need of a Browers.
